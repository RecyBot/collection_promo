## RecyBot: Smartphone Recycling


More than 1.4 mln smartphones are sold each year in the world. More than 1 mln is discarded. More than 90% end up in the landfills. We are going to change that. We create a robotic system for automatic smartphone dissassembly.

This is a video of our current prototypes:

Give us your previous smartphones. We will collect a dataset to teach our robots automatically disassemble it.

Let's do the recycling right!
